# Usabilla

Here are some of my notes regarding the test assignment.

*Please note that I had to change the HTML file for both versions to make the design responsible. I added meta tag:*
```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

### To build the project localy please compile Sass files first:

- Clone Usabilla project
- Navigate to Usabilla project directory in your Terminal
- Navigate to sass directory
- Execute the folowing:
```
sass form.scss ../form.css
```

### Visit the page on Github pages: http://valery-sizikova.github.io/usabilla/ 

### Have a look at the alternative design for the radio buttons by switching to "new-radion-btns" branch. I had to change the HTML file a little bit to make this version work, that's why I don't use this one as my oficial version.
